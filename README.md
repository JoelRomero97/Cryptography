# Cryptography
Some classical/modern ciphers in C language to encrypt and decrypt important information and keep the information safe, such as integrity, authentication, confidentiality and availability of the data

Nowadays, Security of Information is vital because of the danger that the mismanagement of the information can bring to you.

In this repository, you can find some real-life applications, for example, the implementation of EEA (Extended Euclidean Algorithm) for finding the multiplicative inverse of a number to use it to decrypt a message with Affine Cipher.
Also, you'll find the algorithm for encrypting/decrypting a BMP image to protect the information of your users with Hill Cipher and different Modes Of Operation such as ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR.
