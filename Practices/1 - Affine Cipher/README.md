# Affine Cipher

Classical cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages using 2 parameters (alpha and beta), with some restrictions implemented with EEA (Extended Euclidean Algorithm)

# Encryption

- Write the message you want to encrypt on "plaintext.txt" file
- Compilation: gcc Affine.c -o Affine
- Execution: Affine.exe
- Select option 1
- Give a value for alpha (multiplicative value) and beta (additive value)
- Check the encrypted message on "ciphered.txt"

# Decryption

- Compilation: gcc Affine.c -o Affine
- Execution: Affine.exe
- Select option 2
- Give the same values for alpha and beta you use to encrypt the message
- The original message will be written on the console
