# Affine Cipher

Classical cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages using 2 parameters (alpha and beta), with some restrictions implemented with EEA (Extended Euclidean Algorithm)

Compile and run the program selecting option 2 and giving it values for alpha and beta
The encrypted message is in "c.txt" file

# Decryption
