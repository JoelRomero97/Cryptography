# AES

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most known and safest ciphers with a security of 128 bits (the security of a cipher is given by the length of the key to avoid a brute force).

In this practice, we implement this cipher in Python with the next 5 different modes of operation for BMP images:

- Electronic Codebook
- Cipher Block Chaining
- Cipher Feedback
- Output Feedback
- Counter
