# SHA

Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is a Cryptographic Hash Function for encrypting at most 2^64 bits.

This kind of functions are most used in Databases for integrity of data, because a little bit changed in the message, changes completely the output. They have something special, produce a message digest, it means that you can't decrypt it, in this case, SHA - 1 gives an output of 20 bytes.
