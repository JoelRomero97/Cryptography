# Permutation

Data Encryption Standard (DES) is one of the most known ciphers with a security of 64 bits (the security of a cipher is given by the length of the key to avoid a brute force).

One of the stages of this cipher is called permutation, it mixes bit by bit to mix the complete message, this stage is located at the beginning and at the end of the diagram (at the end is called inverse permutation). This program mixes a 4-byte string introduced by the user with an invented permutation (not the one that appears on the RFC of DES).
